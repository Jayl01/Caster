Caster is a game where the main player, a spellcaster, has four types of elemental abilities available to them.

The abilities are available as a small ability rotation UI in the bottom of their screen which they can control through scrolling.

Using these abilities results in a rune being palced at the cursor which does whatever action the ability is based on for a few seconds. For exmaple, lightining would zap at nearby moving entities and chain them as well.

The premise is about multiple enemies of different types being stronger/weaker to the spellcaster's abilities, forcing the player to mix-n-match the abilities to kill enemies effectively.

There should also be interactable objects like explosive barrels that, say, explode with fire! Or electronics that get charged by electricity, etc.

When you're given an OP mix of abilities, just how much destruction can you cause?
